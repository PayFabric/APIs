# API JSON Objects
PayFabric uses JSON objects to send and receive client data. This is the official reference documentation for JSON objects used in the PayFabric REST API.

## Address
Address objects represent the shipping or billing address of a customer. This object may be included as a child attribute of other JSON objects (such as [Card](#card)).

## Gateway Account Profile
A Gateway Account Profile is the account information of a single Payment Gateway. This is created by the merchant on the PayFabric server via the PayFabric web portal. See [Setup Gateway Account](https://github.com/PayFabric/Portal/wiki#setup-gateway-account) for more details.
