Transaction Adjustment
=================

Transaction adjustment API provide ability to adjust tip, increment authorization and correct authorization for approved EVO Snap* transactions.  Please note that all requests require API authentication, see our [guide](Authentication.md) on how to authenticate.

<b>Adjust Tip</b> 
<b>Incremental Authorization</b> represent additions to previously authorized amounts and do not replace the original authorization. The sum of all linked estimated and incremental authorizations represents the total amount authorized for a given transaction.
<b>Correct Authorization</b> transactions are used to assist issuing banks with managing a cardholderâ€™s open-to-buy balance, allowing optimal use of their funds.  This processing is especially important for prepaid cards and debit cardholders where the balance represents a checking or savings account balance.
