PayFabric APIs - Version 3.0
==============
PayFabric APIs are organized around Representational State Transfer (**REST**) architecture and are designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. Below are the API endpoints:

1. Live Server:    ``https://www.payfabric.com/payment/api``
1. Sandbox Server: ``https://sandbox.payfabric.com/payment/api``

Where do I start?

Authentication
--------------
PayFabric clients require PayFabric *Device ID* and *Password*  to authenticate with APIs.

We have a [detailed guide](Sections/Authentication.md) for authenticating your users with our APIs.


AppID
--------------
PayFabric's 3rd party integrator or integration partner will be provided with an AppID to be submitted through PayFabric Transaction APIs. The AppID  helps identify the application source for the corresponding transaction.

Please submit a name-value-pair under **Document** object > **UserDefined** section with the Name 'AppID'. The value will be the AppID value provided to you by PayFabric Support team. 

Example:
"UserDefined": 
[
	 { "Name": "AppID", "Value": "Custom_App" }
]

Handling Exceptions
-------------------
PayFabric uses HTTP response codes to indicate the status of requests. 

We have a [guide](Sections/Errors.md) detailing the meanings of the most common response codes that you will encounter. 


API Documentation
-----------------
PayFabric sends and receives payloads as structured [JSON Objects](Sections/Objects.md). 
Many of these objects are used in both requests and responses. Some of the objects (like Address or Cardholder) are embedded
as child elements of other objects.
